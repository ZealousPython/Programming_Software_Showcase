                    <h2>Learn Different Programming Languages</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the two years we spend in this course we learn many programming langues. 
                        C# with Microsoft .Net platform to develop Windows apps, C# is also used for game development in Unity. 
                        We learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development. 
                        Java is taught at the beginning of Senior Year and is one of the biggest programming languages. 
                        Later in Senior Year Kotlin and React Native is taught for mobile development.

                    <h2>Work On Your Own Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the year we get time to make our own projects and research and use other languages. 
                        For example we had a small unit that focused on making games in Unity, but if you wanted to explore unity more you have the option to do so during these times.
                        Many other projects have been worked on such as a product inventory system using Java, A Javascript game with a scoreboard working off a database, and a various games developed in Unity.

                    <h2>Web Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the second half of junior year we learn how to develop web apps. To do this we learn how to use HTML for the content of the page. 
                        CSS which controls the look and layout of the page. 
                        Javascript which adds more complex functions to certain aspects of the website. 
                        We also learn how to use multiple external librarys such as Bootstrap for easier design of websites.

                        You also get to choose other competions such as Python, Databases, Interview skills, Software Engineering. The most recent Software Engineering event was developing a game. 
                        Aswell if you do well enough in the first competions you move on to state competions and then nationals where we have a total of 6 students going this year. For nationals we get flown out of state the most recent one takes place in Dallas Texas.
