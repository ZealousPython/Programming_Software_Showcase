                    Throughout the two years we spend in this course we learn many programming languages.
                    C# with Microsoft .Net platform to develop Windows apps, C# is also used for game development in
                    Unity.
                    We learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development.
                    Java is taught at the beginning of Senior Year and is one of the biggest programming languages.
                    Later in Senior Year Kotlin and React Native is taught for mobile development.

                <p>
                    Throughout the year we get time to make our own projects and research and use other languages.
                    For example, we had a small unit that focused on making games in Unity, but if you wanted to explore
                    unity more you have the option to do so during these times.
                    Many other projects have been worked on such as a product inventory system using Java, A Javascript
                    game with a scoreboard working off a database, and various games developed in Unity.

                <p>
                    During the second half of junior year, we learn how to develop web apps. To do this we learn how to
                    use HTML for the content of the page.
                    CSS which controls the look and layout of the page.
                    Javascript which adds more complex functions to certain aspects of the website.
                    We also learn how to use multiple external libraries such as Bootstrap for an easier design of
                    websites.
