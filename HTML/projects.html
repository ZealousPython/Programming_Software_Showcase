                <p>In December 2021 a student creeated a rudementary version of the popular arcade game Galaga as part of an assignment to learn how to use C# in the Unity Game Engine.

The enemies can also shoot back at the player and when the player runs out of lives the game ends and the score is displayed. Each of the games pixel sprites were created from scratch using the program Aesprite to create the assets.</p>
